## History
Geocoding scripts were originally written in Java & developed by Erik Paulson.  In spring of 2015, the scripts were rewritten in Python by Matt Michaelson.  The original script used CSV files as inputs and outputs to the script; the latest version reads/writes from a server to eliminate the possibility of human error.
